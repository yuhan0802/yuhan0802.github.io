# üëã About Me
Hi! I'm a Ph.D. student at Xiamen University, working under the guidance of <a href='https://mac.xmu.edu.cn/ljcao/'>Liujuan Cao</a> and <a href='https://mac.xmu.edu.cn/rrji/'>Rongrong Ji</a>. I also collaborate closely with Prof. <a href='https://informatics.xmu.edu.cn/info/1395/25099.htm'>Yiyi Zhou</a> and Prof. <a href='https://yongjiandeng.github.io/'>Yongjian Deng</a> (Beijing university of technology). 

My research interest includes multimodal and efficient training. If you‚Äôre interested in my work or have ideas for collaboration, feel free to reach out via email.

[EPA: Boosting Event-based Video Frame Interpolation with Perceptually Aligned Learning](https://github.com/yuhan0802/EPA)

**Yuhan Liu**, Linghui Fu, Zhen Yang, Hao Chen, Youfu Li, Yongjian Deng

[**Project**](https://github.com/yuhan0802/EPA) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
<p style="color:#7f8c8d;font-style:italic">We propose a novel framework, EPA, which transfers the learning paradigm from an unstable pixel space to a semantically aware feature space insensitive to degradation, in order to overcome the problem of reduced model generalization ability caused by image degradation in training data.</p>

[Neuromorphic event-based recognition boosted by motion-aware learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231225003509)

**Yuhan Liu**, Yongjian Deng, Bochen Xie, Hai Liu, Zhen Yang, Youfu Li

**Project** <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
<p style="color:#7f8c8d;font-style:italic">We propose a motion-aware learning framework that addresses the inability of traditional 2D CNNs to effectively encode motion for event-based recognition. Our method introduces an auxiliary Motion-Aware Branch (MAB) to learn dynamic spatio-temporal correlations, providing complementary motion-centric knowledge that is then fused with the rich spatial semantics from the primary CNN branch for a more robust and comprehensive representation.</p>

[Video Frame Interpolation via Direct Synthesis with the Event-based Reference](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_Video_Frame_Interpolation_via_Direct_Synthesis_with_the_Event-based_Reference_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf)

**Yuhan Liu**, Yongjian Deng, Hao Chen, Zhen Yang

**Project** <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
<p style="color:#7f8c8d;font-style:italic">This paper introduces a novel E-VFI framework that obviates the need for explicit motion estimation by directly synthesizing the target frame. We achieve this by first reconstructing a structural reference of the intermediate scene solely from event data, and then propose a deformable alignment module (E-PCD) to align keyframes to this reference, which significantly enhances the model's ability to handle severe occlusions where traditional motion-based methods typically fail.</p>

[SAM-Event-Adapter: Adapting Segment Anything Model for Event-RGB Semantic Segmentation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10611127/)

Bowen Yao, Yongjian Deng, **Yuhan Liu**, Hao Chen, Youfu Li, Zhen Yang

**Project** <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
<p style="color:#7f8c8d;font-style:italic">This paper introduces SAM-Event-Adapter, a novel and parameter-efficient method to adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for multi-modal Event-RGB semantic segmentation. By freezing the powerful SAM backbone and inserting lightweight adapter modules, we effectively fuse motion cues from event cameras with texture information from RGB images, significantly improving segmentation performance in adverse conditions while avoiding the prohibitive costs and generalization loss associated with full model retraining.</p>
